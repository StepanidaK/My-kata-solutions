You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. 
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

const rooms = {
    room1: {
        name: "room1",
        description: "this is the room1",
        completed: true
    },

    room2: {
        name: "room2",
        description: "this is the room2",
        completed: false
    },

    room3: {
        name: "room3",
        description: "this is the room3",
        completed: true
    }
}
